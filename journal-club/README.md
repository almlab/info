# Flash Journal Club

For the first 15-ish minutes of each 
[lab meeting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17K3eK_GNoXbfFCrVFLCtRt8-y-yPYsn6nRgP5LRPi04/edit#gid=1242452859), 
we'll have 1-3 people run through 1-2 papers' figures. If we don't have lab meeting, we will still run journal club.

We'll focus on the content, not so much the background (assumption is we have 
most relevant background). It's like an espresso shot of science.

The journal club discussion will be cut off after 15 minutes. Each presenter should talk for no more than 5 minutes.

# Submitting slides

Please upload your slides to this folder in pdf format. You should have no more than 3 slides.

Title your slides: `YYYY-MM-DD_first-author_journal_keywords.pdf`, where the date corresponds to the
day of group meeting.

If you don't want to deal with uploading your slides or don't know how, you can
also email them to Isaac or Claire (irockafe or duvallet at mit dot edu).

If you want to add animations to your slides, just make each step of the animation of a new slide. It works just the same!
