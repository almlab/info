# How to contribute

We encourage all Alm lab users to contribute to this repo. If you
see something that's out of date, please update it! If you don't have
enough information to update it, please point it out to someone who does.

## Getting set up to contribute

In order to contribute, you need to have your own GitHub account
(either Enterprise or normal is good). Once you have an account, ask a
[member](https://github.com/orgs/almlab/people) of the almlab repo to add you
as a member. Once you're added, you should have full push access to this repo!

## Contributing

We want the information in this repo to be as useful to as many people as
possible. This means that if you see something missing, you should add it!
If you see something wrong, you can fix it! If you see something unclear,
go for it and clarify it!

Remember to make sure the repo is up to date in your local directory before pushing changes!!

### Quickstart commands
You need to clone the full alm lab info repository to a local directory before making changes:  
`$ git clone https://github.com/almlab/info`  
(now edit and add files wherever you like!)  
`$ git add <file(s) of your choice>`  
`$ git commit -m "message about why you are making these changes"`  
`$ git push`  

If you already have the info repo cloned into your local git you can skip the first step and replace it with:
`$ git pull`  

#### README.md files
If you want a file that you add to automatically show up as text (like this
file), it needs to be the README.md in a directory. Feel free to make new
directories which have a descriptive name, and which contain only a README.md
file with basic info.

If you change the directory structure of this repo, please try to update this
main README.md file with your changes.

GitHub will automatically render markdown (`.md`) files into the pretty format
that you're currently reading. Markdown is a plain-text formatting syntax
that's meant to be easy to read as-is and that can also make nicely formatted
documents super easily. It's very [easy to learn](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet),
and understanding just a few basic examples can take you a long way!

#### Other files

GitHub will automatically render Markdown files, will happily show raw text
files (including code), and can also preview files like pdfs and pictures.
If you have a different file type, you can totally upload it too! Unless you save
it as something that GitHub recognizes, though, users will have to download it
before they can look at it.

#### This is a public repo!

For the sake of simplicity and maximum usability, we're keeping this repo public.
This means that anyone can see anything that you put in here. More specifically,
this means that:   
- You should not put any full emails in any files. Replace `@` symbols with `at`
so that spammy computer parsers don't recognize the emails!
- You shouldn't post any data, software, or opinions that you aren't comfortable
being public.

## What should you include?

Basically, the idea for this repo is for it to be as useful to as many Almstars as possible.
So if there's something you think would be useful to you or to others, feel free to include it!
This includes, and is not limited to:
- things you get asked about all the time and are tired of repeating
- things you've figured out (sometimes the hard way) and want other people to have an easier time with than you did
  - installation instructions for a software that's missing a crucial dependency
  - how to download things from a database system that can be infuriating if you don't know where to look
- information you always have to google or search through your email for, so that it's now in an easy
place that you know where to find
- materials from workshops that you've hosted
- jokes and gifs
