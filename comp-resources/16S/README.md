Processing 16S data is surprisingly non-standard. Here are some
resources to help you figure out what to do:

# 16S resources

## The AWS pipeline

We have a 16S processing pipeline on our AWS cloud. You can find more info about it [here](https://github.com/thomasgurry/amplicon_sequencing_pipeline/blob/master/documentation/amplicon_sequencing_processing_pipeline.pdf)

## QIIME

[QIIME](qiime.org) is great to do standard quick-and-dirty 16S processing.

[The Werner Lab](http://www.wernerlab.org/teaching/qiime) has some good tutorials on how to use QIIME
(in addition to QIIME's own stuff, of course).

## Workshops

Members of the Alm lab frequently host workshops related to 16S processing.
Copies of these files can be found in this folder.
