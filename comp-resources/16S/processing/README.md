Processing 16S data is surprisingly non-standard. Here are some
resources to help you figure out what to do:

## The AWS pipeline

We have a 16S processing pipeline on our AWS cloud. You can find more info about it [here](https://github.com/thomasgurry/amplicon_sequencing_pipeline/blob/master/documentation/amplicon_sequencing_processing_pipeline.pdf)


## QIIME

QIIME is great to do standard quick-and-dirty 16S processing.

## Workshops

Members of the Alm lab frequently host workshops related to 16S processing.
Copies of these files can be found in this folder.
