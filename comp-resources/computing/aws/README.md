# AWS Common Use Standards

## Computing in the Alm lab

Lots of people in the Alm lab do compuational work. We have multiple resources as
our disposal, the biggest of which are coyote and AWS.

coyote is adminstrated by [greg] (alm-admin@techsquare.com). We pay to share this
resource with a few other MIT labs. coyote has a different set of standards and use
which are not covered in this document.

AWS is administrated by Thomas Gurry (thomasgurry@gmail.com) and Xiaofang Jiang (xiaofang@mit.edu).
The Alm lab pays for everything related to our AWS usage, and Thomas and Xiaofang
are basically volunteering their time to administer this common resource.

We have a Moira email list for computational-related things, alm-comp@mit.edu.
You can add or remove yourself from this and other Moira lists at: groups.mit.edu/webmoira/ .


# Introduction to AWS
What is AWS?
What do we use it for?
Costs money


# Data storage
Command to check your usage
Keep majority of data on S3


# Installing
Python packages: use conda install first.
Software: if for general use (eg sratoolkit, etc), put in a common /bin. Otherwise keep it in your directory


# Safeguarding your work
Use a virtual environment, use terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux (and name your sessions or be at the mercy of someone elseâ€™s mistaken deletion!)
Make sure to backup your code (github is gr8)
Keep data on S3
MIT provides infinite Dropbox storage - take advantage too!


# Sharing resources
Sharing code
16S processing info
Metagenomics/etc info?
Communicating about issues
Asking for help (alm-comp@mit.edu)
Name your data and work so future people can find it!
