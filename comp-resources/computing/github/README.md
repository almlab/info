Github is great to share code, keep text files under version control, and
back up your files.

## github.com

Pros:
- easy to collaborate with anyone

Cons:
- limited number of private repos (unless you sign up with your .mit.edu email address? Not sure.)


## github.mit.edu

As MIT affiliates, we have free access to GitHub Enterprise.

Pros:
- unlimited free repos
- pretty sure it's suuuper secure

Cons:
- can't collaborate with non-MIT Enterprise users

Gotchas:
- sign in is done with certificates, so don't put in a password if you're ever asked for one.
