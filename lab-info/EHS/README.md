# Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) for the Alm lab
When you join the lab, there are several EHS-related tasks that you need to do to be cleared to work in the lab.  Before you can accomplish any of these tasks you need to obtain a Kerberos ID (your Kerberos is the username used to log onto MIT computers, and is your MIT email address as well).

## General materials for EHS representative

## To do list
1.  Read the following to get set up on Atlas: https://ehs.mit.edu/site/training
2.  Take the required training modules.  For the Alm lab, which is BL2, in addition to whatever requirements are stated in your Atlas training center, you need to take:
    * General Biosafety for Researchers
    * General Chemical Hygiene
    * Managing Hazardous Waste
    * Bloodborne pathogens: researchers
Some of these may be completed online, while others will require a class at EHS.  You are recommended to sign up to the latter as quickly as possible to avoid delays in your ability to work in the wet lab.
3.  Review the department's chemical hygiene program: https://ehs.mit.edu/site/content/chemical-hygiene-program
4.  Download the clearance form (https://be-ehs.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/BE%20Clearform.pdf), complete it and obtain Eric's signature.  _AFTER_ completing and obtaining Eric's signature, bring the form to the EHS rep for them to submit it on your behalf.
5.  Request lab-specific training from EHS representative.  This should take approximately 30 minutes in the wet lab.  You will then complete the following training roster to confirm you have taken lab-specific training: https://be-ehs.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/EHS_class_signup_sheet_lab_specific.pdf

Once you have done all of the above, you should be good to go!
