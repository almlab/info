# Schedule

The group meeting schedule is coordinated by Shandrina and can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17K3eK_GNoXbfFCrVFLCtRt8-y-yPYsn6nRgP5LRPi04/edit?usp=sharing).

# Unofficial group meetings

On weeks when Eric is away, people can self-organize informal presentations/discussions if desired,
but this will not be coordinated by Shandrina or otherwise formalized. These will be entirely optional.
